# HackerRank
My solutions to various HackerRank.com challenges.  I very much enjoy solving the challenges at HackerRank.com and thought that it would be fun to share with others my solutions so that they can see how I think and solve these programming problems.  Even though every solution that I put up will pass every test case that HackerRank.com puts it through, they still may not be perfect.  If you have a comment on any of my solutions feel free to contact me and let me know what you think!

I am currently a Computer Science student at Arizona State University expecting to graduate December 2017 with my Master's Degree.  As you can see from this repo, I choose Java, C#, and C++ as my languages of choice.  From my industry jobs at American Express, Garmin International, and ActiveG, I have gained a lot of experience working with databases, web services, and mobile applications, which happens to me my interests.
